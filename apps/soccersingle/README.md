## Niblet downstream maintenance

This directory contains Niblet changes to Starlark source, compared with the shared Tronbyt ancestor in the September 21, 2026 audit. Downstream maintenance contact: [edwin-page](https://github.com/edwin-page). Original author and license notices remain in the source, manifest, and any original documentation below. Maintenance credit does not replace original authorship.

The configuration schema differs from the audited upstream baseline. Check the current schema and test existing saved settings before switching versions; differences may include labels as well as behavior.

Original authors and other contributors can follow [Updating your app](../../docs/UPDATING_YOUR_APP.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md). Preserve app IDs, settings compatibility, original credits, and applicable licenses. Describe changes and actual test results in your pull request.

See [known compatibility differences](../../docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) and [maintenance history](../../docs/MAINTENANCE.md). These notes do not certify live integration or compatibility with every runtime. Earlier setup instructions below may describe the upstream version.

# Track single soccer team across all global tournaments / leagues they are playing in

Show upcoming / current / future game for a single soccer team across all leagues / tournaments they play in - one app tracks the team everywhere.  Handles all ESPN API leagues / tournaments.
Approx 3000 teams globally are in this app (2500 men's teams & 500 women's teams - including professional, international and college)

Displayed:

- Home / Away Teams & current record (if applicable for current league / tournament)
- Game's League / Tournament abbreviation
- If future game: Date & Time of upcoming game
- If inprogress game:  Score & Time
- If past game:  Final Score  (as per ESPN API - scores flip over to next game at 1AM US ET - future version coming to assist with this)

## Configuration
- Enter text to search team name (minimum 4 characters) - Women's teams are prefixed with a W & Men's with an M
- Which team to display first (home or away)
- Select display format type
- Select color for time (uses new schema.Color)
- 12 hour vs 24 hour time & US vs Intl date format

## Thanks

Tons of thanks to @whyamihere/@rs7q5 for the API assistance - couldn't have gotten here without you
Thanks to @dinotash/@dinosaursrarr for making me think deep thoughts about connected schema fields & @matslina for setting me straight.
Of course - the original author of a bunch of this display code is @Lunchbox8484
Thanks to @jesushairdo for the option to be able to show home or away team first.  Let's be more international :-)
